# XL 2 JSON

You know how sometimes clients will send translation files in excel format?  As web developers, we all know we can't really use them as is.  So I've created a program here that will convert excel documents into valid json, that you can then use in any programming language that supports json.

## Setup

Just run the python file.  It requires openpyxl.  It will get you to type some input in order to correctly build your data.
